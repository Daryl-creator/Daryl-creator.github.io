                What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?
            </p>
            <br><br>

            <ul class="list-group">
                <li class="list-group-item">1. I have to stop feeling bad about looking at others peoples code when
                    learning, it is
                    a way of learning and sometimes it is good to look at someone who has done it before for
                    inspiration. As long as
                    you can understand what the code is doing and you are not copying the code directly.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">2. The EGO tends to resurface when I am tired or hungry or have been stuck
                    on a problem
                    for too long and that the best thing to do at that point is to walk away and come back and try again
                    another
                    time or day.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">3. I have learned to be kinder to myself when I found the learning tough.
                    One technique
                    I found helps is to reflect on what I learn that day/week/month that I didn't know prior. It is
                    easier on the
                    soul when you reflect on how far you've come rather than always thinking about how much you have to
                    learn.</li>
            </ul><br><br>

            <p class="h2">
                What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <p class="h6">
                Your values determine how much you see the importance or worth in something. If you see learning and
                programming of
                high value, you will put in the time and effort to learn it no matter how tough it gets. A high level of
                empathy is
                needed in learning to program and working with others who are also learning to program. Learning such a
                demanding
                skill, the likelyhood is that you are going to be working with people who are under stress or pressure.
                A high level
                of empathy
                will help everyone learn cohesively. Self awareness goes in tandem with Empathy, your team members will
                respond to
                your emotions in different ways. Especially as a leader, a strong sense of self awareness will help you
                recognise
                your strengths and weaknesses and therefore gain the trust of your team members.

                What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <p class="h6">
                That is takes concious and continous effort to apply the learnings.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="h2">
                What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <p class="h6">
                That is takes concious and continous effort to apply the learnings.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="h2">
                Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web
                development
                bootcamp course?
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <p class="h6">
                Because you will almost always be working with other people, good core skills ensure that you are a
                valuable member
                of a team.

            <p class="h2">
                Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used
                that time
                to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <p class="h6">
                Not at all, an example is because I made the effort to pair program and learn with others early, I
                maximised my learning experience.

            <p class="h6">
                My Long term plan at this is to be in EdTech, I love teaching and passing on knowledge and have a real
                passion for
                helping others along their Journey. After completing my Commercial Pilots Licence I completed a Flight
                Instructors
                Course. I found that this helped me in 2 distinct ways. It made me a much better and holistic Aviator as
                I had to
                learn and practice the concepts I learnt well to be able to teach it to someone else. I also enjoyed
                watching my
                students go on to flying all around the world and their gratitude that I was a part of their Journey
                gives me a
                highi level of satisfaction.

                What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?

            <br><br>
            <p class="h6">
                My biggest strenghs are my communication skills and a developed sense of empathy when in a fast paced
                and high pressure learning enviroment.
                My limitations are learning to learn in a new way where looking at solutions and other peoples code are
                encouraged as well as
            </p>

                What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <p class="h6">
                It will be learning to go easy on myself when I don't learn something as quick as I would like. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p class="h2">
                What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <p class="h6">
                My teaching and facilitation skills. The ability to learn something and quickly pass on that information
                to someone else as this will help me to learn the information to a deeper and whole level.
            </p>

            <p class="h2">
                What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <p class="h6">
                I have approached bootcamp with an open book. Eveything that I have known about learning I choose to
                turn over a blank page and develop myself from the ground up. As I have said before, I leave my ego at
                th door and dedicate myself whole heartedly to this learning experience.
