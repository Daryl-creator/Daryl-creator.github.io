            <p class="h2">Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</p><br><br>
            <p class="h6">Understanding Neuroplasticity helps quell the anxieties I was having that I was ‘too old’ or that it was ‘too hard’ or that I was ‘too late’ to pick up a new skill. Knowing that the brain is constantly learning and constantly improving gives me the confidence to strive on and remember to look back at what you have learnt instead of always looking at what you still need to learn.</p><br>
            <p class="h2">Discuss how might you engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your own benefit</p><br><br>
            <p class="h6">Because neuroplasticity is the process that makes your brain extremely resilient and by which all permanent learning takes place, I continue to do things that make me uncomfortable everyday because I know that in the background, the brain is growing and adapting. It is having that trust that you are putting new information away and what you find difficult today will not be one day.</p><br>
            <p class="h2">What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity</p><br><br>
            <p class="h6">I have 3 things that I work on everyday, something that grows me physically, creatively and spiritually. I find that having these 3 things creates a good balance for wellness and really optimises my learning.</p><br>

              <p class="h2">Discuss what the growth mindset is and why it is relevant</p><br><br>
              <p class="h6">Carol Dweck in her research found that a A “growth mindset,” thrives on challenge and sees failure not as evidence of unintelligence but as a heartening springboard for growth and for stretching our existing abilities</p><br>
              <p class="h2">In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</p><br><br>
              <p class="h6">This has been an ongoing journey for me, but I continuously work on embracing my own insecurities. Everyone has them and I knew very early on that to really soar and embrace the growth mindset. I would have to get comfortable with them and allow them to be beacons to where I needed to work on instead of hiding them away. That being said, because it reaches into the deepest part of your souls, it's not an easy process!</p><br>
              <p class="h2">How will you integrate a growth mindset into your learning journey?</p><br><br>
              <p class="h6">Telling myself "Not yet!". Growth Journey for me will be instilled everyday, everyday I am learning something new in an area which I have not had any experience before. With reference to what I said above regarding my insecurities, I will embrace my learnings everyday and celebrate both successes and failures. The thing I will continue to do is to be open about who I am, what drives me what scares me. I feel that by being honest and leaving the ego out, that is where I can really invite people to help me grow along my journey.</p><br>
