         Tell us about a time you got stuck on a simple problem.
        </p>
        <br><br>
    
        <p class="h6">
          I was stuck on the superFizzBuzz kata for a while. I was new to Coding and didn't know how to approach a problem. I used
          the rubber ducky method and pseudocade but i felt that i was still missing the structure to approaching problem solving.
          I was feeling uncomfortable and out of my depth. I started reading researching problem solving and reliased I could try
          modifying a management model I was using in my old industry to see if I could use it to approach a coding problem and
          found that it worked! I learnt that I could use previous experience methods to hang my hat on whilst I was still
          building my experience in coding.
        </p>
        <br>
    
        <p class="h2">How did you solve a problem in an elegant way - S-DODAR
    
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <div class="text-center">
          <img src="../images/fizzBuzz.png" class="rounded" alt="control-flow">
        </div>
        <br><br>
        <p class="h6">Using the SuperFizzBuzz problem as an example. I applied my model to working out the problem as shown below:
        <br><br>
        <ul class="list-group">
          <li class="list-group-item">S - Self - Stretch, take a walk, eat something. Sometimes we're so in depth with problem
            solving that we don't even realise we have hit a limit and need to take a step back to reset and see this bigger
            picture.</li>
          <li class="list-group-item">D - Diagnose - I asked myself "What is the problem?", and i was very detailed and
            deliberate with asking this question, even down to looking at every character to check for syntax and case
            descrepencies. I wrote down my answers until I could logically see the problem and the steps to tackle it. I was
            Pseudocoding but also planning.</li>
          <li class="list-group-item">O - Options - This is where i look at the various options to tackling the problem. I had
            all the options listed in a later part of this article. In this case I decided that Google was the best step.</li>
          <li class="list-group-item">D - Decide - After I decided my next step I set about thinking about i was going to
            implement it. How I was going to phrase the question and what I expected to see.</li>
          <li class="list-group-item">A - Assign - This would be the step I would assign tasks to my team however it works just
            as well on your own. I listed the tasks that needed to be done i.e. find the answer, implement the code, check the
            syntax, look at it's control flow.</li>
          <li class="list-group-item">R - Review - Here the tests helped me alot, was it working? If not why? I linked this step
            back into the Diagnose part if it wasn't and keep looping through the steps until I solved the problem. If it was
            taking some time, i would go back to 'S' and go from there.</li>

        <p class="h6">
          I used all the following techniques and processes during my challenges. This is how I have found using them so far:
        </p><br>
        <ul class="list-group">
          <li class="list-group-item">Pseudocode - I use this allot however i was drawing them on my Ipad. I will use more of
            the '//' comment method on the code as this will help other developers see my thoughts and problems when working on
            problems in a team.</li>
          <li class="list-group-item">Trying something - I was doing this all the time and then reverse engineering if I came
            accross the solution.</li>
          <li class="list-group-item">Rubber Duck - Definately one of my favourite technqiues.</li>
          <li class="list-group-item">Reading error messages. Here is a good example os using the technology to your advantage.
            I looked at it as the computer telling me "I'm not happy with the code you wrote and here's why".</li>
          <li class="list-group-item">Console.log - I definately used this alot, however I am learning specifically where to use
            it to see specific parts of the code rather than just using it as a final test at the end.</li>
          <li class="list-group-item">Google - My best friend.</li>
          <li class="list-group-item">Asking Peers - This is my PRIMARY method at the moment, I enjoy collaborating with others
            thus am always working on problems with others. I find that most of the times we can get to solution quicker as well
            as all of us benefiting from the learning outcomes of each others.</li>
          <li class="list-group-item">Asking Coaches - I have had to do this a handful of times If i got really stuck but found
            that if I implemented the other techniques above, I was solving the problems before needing to ask the coaches for
            help</li>
          <li class="list-group-item">Reflections - This is an essential part of my learning. At the end of the day I always ask
            myself "what did I learn today?" and "What will i bring to tomorrow?".</li>
        </ul><br><br>
